# Survival-Analysis-and-Predictive-Modeling-for-Shipwreck-Disasters

In order to gain insights into the dataset and understand the relationships between features and survival, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted. This involved examining various characteristics of the dataset, such as distributions, missing values, and correlations between variables. 

Subsequently, Machine Learning models, specifically Random Forests and Gradient Boosting, were developed to predict passenger survival based on factors such as sex, age, and cabin class. These models were chosen for their ability to handle complex relationships and provide reliable predictions. 

To improve the performance of the models, advanced techniques such as feature selection and evaluation metrics were employed. Feature selection helped identify the most important variables that contribute to survival prediction, while evaluation metrics provided a measure of model accuracy. 

The ultimate goal of these efforts was to optimize the performance of the models, ensuring accurate predictions in disaster relief scenarios. By leveraging the power of Machine Learning and employing these techniques, the models aimed to assist in making informed decisions and efficiently allocate resources for maximum impact.
